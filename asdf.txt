Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) typically include the following types of firewalls:

Packet-filtering firewall: NGFWs inspect each packet of data that passes through the network and decide whether to allow or block it based on predefined rules.

Stateful inspection firewall: NGFWs also track the state of each connection passing through the network and make decisions based on the context of the connection.

Application-level firewall: NGFWs examine traffic at the application layer and make decisions based on the specific application or service that the traffic is trying to access.
